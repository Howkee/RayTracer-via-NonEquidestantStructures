The master's degree project.
The purpose of this work is to study the method of ray tracing, its improvement through the use of non-equidistant structures in order to speed up the calculations for the 3D-scene to obtain the most realistic image.

Program RayTraser is part of the research work done during the writing of the master's work. 
The program is written in C ++ with using CMake.

The main purpose of the program is to create a picture and calculate shadows, reflection and refraction of light.
The engine developed in the work implements the basic functions, but is far from ideal, and can be improved. In particular, you can add a lot of improvements to make the developed program useful not only in the research field:
• calculation of non-point light sources;
• gradations of shadows
etc.

In the future, the project will not be improved.
